# *Stormworks Addon Lua Documentation*

## üìö Overview
GitHub repository containing all of the documentation for Stormworks: Build and Rescue's Addon Lua.

Unfortunately, the documentation in this repository is just categorized screenshots of the in-game documentation instead of actual text (‚ö†Ô∏è **Screenshots no longer maintained**). However, there is an `intellisense.lua` file containing all Addon Lua functions, types, and callbacks that can provide intellisense (auto-completion, etc) as long as you have the file in your addon workspace and if you have the Lua LSP VSCode extension installed and enabled.

**The documentation can be found in `/docs`.**
