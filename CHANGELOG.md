# ðŸ“š | Changelog
Last updated for game version: v1.14.3 (The Firefighter SCBA Update)
Note that even if the above version is outdated on the latest version of this repo, it means no 
functions were added, changed or removed from the game since the update.

Corrections and changes to the documentation may still be made after the game version is outdated
anyway.

The following changelog entries are in DD/MM/YY format.

## 28/09/2025
- Fix invalid return annotation for `server.getCharacterItem` (return type and name were swapped).

## 25/07/2025
- `SWEquipmentTypeEnum` is now the return type instead of `integer` for `server.getCharacterItem`.

## 10/07/2025
- Fix incorrect fact in `server.setPopupScreen` (-1 is top for vertical offset, not bottom).

## 25/05/2025
- Added new `firefighter_scba` equipment type.
- Refactored a few comments.

## 07/05/2025
- Fixed the messed up description for `server.getObjectSimulating`.

## 14/04/2025
- Added more information to `debug.log` description such as how to view the logs.

## 09/04/2025

## 06/04/2025
- Removed unmaintained documentation screenshots in the repo.
- Clarified the above comment about the version being outdated.
- Set param names to lowercase in `server.getSeasonalEvent`, `server.setCharacterItem` and `server.getCharacterItem`
- In `server.setGameSetting`, `GameSettingString` was renamed to `game_setting` to stay consistent. This was done in some other functions too.

- Documented hidden undocumented functions. They are mainly aliases of existing functions  
    These undocumented functions are untested. I found them in the global `server` table, but I've never used them.
